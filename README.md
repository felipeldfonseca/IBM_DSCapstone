  <h1>SpaceX Capstone Project - Predicting Launch Prices and First Stage Reuse</h1>
  
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This repository contains the code and resources for the SpaceX Capstone project, which aimed to determine the price of each launch and predict if SpaceX would reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket. The project utilized machine learning techniques and public information to make these predictions, providing valuable insights for a fictional rocket company, Space Y, looking to compete with SpaceX.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The project involved the following key components:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Data Gathering and Preprocessing: Relevant data on SpaceX launches was collected, including mission parameters, payload information, and historical first stage landing outcomes. Data quality checks and preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the dataset for analysis.</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering: Key features influencing the successful landing and reuse of the first stage were identified. Factors such as payload characteristics, orbital parameters, and customer requirements were analyzed. Informative features were engineered to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning model.</li>
    <li>Machine Learning Model Development: A predictive model was developed to forecast the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully. Appropriate machine learning algorithms were employed, and the model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned. Rigorous evaluation techniques were applied to validate the model's performance.</li>
    <li>Dashboard Creation: Interactive dashboards were designed using data visualization tools to present project findings effectively. These dashboards enable stakeholders at Space Y to monitor launch costs, track first stage reuse probabilities, and make informed decisions based on the predictions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Project Success and Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    The SpaceX Capstone project achieved several significant outcomes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pricing Determination: Through data analysis and machine learning techniques, we successfully determined the price of each SpaceX launch, taking into account the cost-saving potential of first stage reuse. These insights would help Space Y gain a competitive advantage by formulating effective pricing strategies.</li>
    <li>First Stage Reuse Prediction: By training a machine learning model on public information, we developed a reliable prediction mechanism to estimate if SpaceX would reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket for a given mission. This information would allow Space Y to anticipate SpaceX's competitive advantage offered by their reuse capabilities.</li>
    <li>Decision Support: The interactive dashboards created provide comprehensive insights into all launches across different launch stations in the US. These visualizations empower stakeholders at Space Y to make data-driven decisions related to business strategy, investment, and resource allocation.</li>
  </ul>
